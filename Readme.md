# Fit Today

This is a simple app to manage your meals and calories, so you can watch out for that extra fat!

# Main Frameworks

We are working with [Node v6.3.0](https://nodejs.org/en/) for our backend and [Angular 1.x](https://angularjs.org/) for our frontend. We chose [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/) as our UI Component Framework.

For our test suite we are using [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html) with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) to run our front and back end tests and [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) as our BDD assertion library.
